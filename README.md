# One Track is a Vehicle Management Application written in C#.

## Features:

OT.Blazor: Blazor Frontend
  Calls the NHTSA for VIN lookup.  Some data returned is not 100% accurate to what the door label may say. Testing with my personal truck finds the GVWR and Transmission Speeds to be inaccurate.
  This returns limited information right now as I am just starting and verifying funcionallity as I am going.

OT.Api: Api Backend
  This is the main backend for the application.  It has not been started yet.
